Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose high-level programming language with type inference. It was designed to interoperate fully with Java and is commonly used for Android app development. Kotlin is known for its conciseness, safety, and ease of use, making it a popular choice for developers. It is also used for server-side development, multiplatform mobile development, and data science tasks[1][2].
